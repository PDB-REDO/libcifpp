Version 5.2.5
- Correctly import the Eigen3 library

Version 5.2.4
- Changes required to build on Windows

Version 5.2.3
- New constructors for cif::item, one taking std::optional values
  and another taking only a name resulting in a value '.' (i.e. inapplicable).
- added cif::cell::get_volume

Version 5.2.2
- Remove dependency on Eigen3 for users of libcifpp
- Fix typos in documentation
- Do not build latex files in documentation
- Fixed conversion from string to integer, would fail on +2 e.g.
- sqrt is not constexpr, thus kGoldenRatio should be const, not constexpr

Version 5.2.1
- New versionstring module
- small fixes for generating documentation
- correctly setting SONAME

Version 5.2.0
- With lots of documentation
- Refactored coloured text output

  header file pdb.hpp for I/O of legacy PDB files.

Version 5.1.3
- Dropped pkgconfig support

Version 5.1.2
- New version string code
- Added check for Eigen3 in cifppConfig.cmake

Version 5.1.1
- Added missing include <compare> in symmetry.hpp
- Added empty() to matrix
- Fix for parsing legacy PDB files with a last line that does
  not end with a new line character.

Version 5.1
- New parser, optimised for speed
- Fix in unique ID generator

Version 5.0.10
- Fix in progress_bar, was using too much CPU
- Optimised mmCIF parser

Version 5.0.9
- Fix in dihedral angle calculations
- Added create_water to model
- Writing twin domain info in PDB files and more PDB fixes
- remove_atom improved (remove struct_conn records)
- Added a specialisation for category::find1<std::optional>
- fix memory leak in category

Version 5.0.8
- implemented find_first, find_min, find_max and count in category
- find1 now throws an exception if condition does not not exactly match one row
- Change in writing out PDB files, now looking up the original auth_seq_num
  via the pdbx_xxx_scheme categories based on the atom_site.auth_seq_num ->
  pdbx_xxx_scheme.pdb_seq_num relationship.
- fix memory leak in category

Version 5.0.7.1
- Use the implementation from zeep for std::experimental::is_detected

Version 5.0.1
- Fix loading dictionaries
- Support for cifv1.0 files

Version 5.0.0
- Total rewrite of cif part
- Removed DSSP code, moved into dssp project itself

Version 4.2.1
- Improved REMARK 3 parser (for TLS in large molecules)

Version 4.2.0
- Yet another rewrite of resource loading

Version 4.1.1
- Fall back to zero charge for scattering factors if the atom
  was not found in the table.
- Improve code to locate resources, failing less.

Version 4.1.0
- Some interface changes for mmcif::Atom

Version 4.0.1
- Added a bunch of const methods to Datablock and Category.
- Changed PDB writing interface to accept Datablock instead of File.

Version 4.0.0
- getResidue in mmcif::Structure now requires both a
  sequence ID and an auth sequence ID. As a result the code was cleaned
  up considerably.

Version 3.0.5
- mmcif::Structure redesign. It is now a wrapper around a cif::Datablock.

Version 3.0.4
- Fix in mmCIF parser, now correctly handles the unquoted
  string ??

Version 3.0.3
- Better configuration checks, for atomic e.g.
- Fixed a problem introduced in refactoring mmcif::Atom
- Version string creation

Version 3.0.2
- refactored mmcif::Atom for performance reasons

Version 3.0.1
- Fixed processing of proline restraints file from CCP4, proline
  is a peptide, really.
- Added code to facilitate DSSP

Version 3.0.0
- Replaced many strings in the API with string_view for
  performance reasons.
- Upgraded mmcif::Structure
- various other small fixes

Version 2.0.5
- Backporting updated CMakeLists.txt file

Version 2.0.4
- Reverted a too strict test when reading cif files.

Version 2.0.3
- Fixed reading mmCIF files where model numbers are used and
  model number 1 is missing.

Version 2.0.2
- Added configuration flag to disable downloading CCD data during build
  Note that there are now two flags for CCD data:
  DOWNLOAD_CCD to enable downloading during build
  INSTALL_UPDATE_SCRIPT to install an update mechanism for this file
- Updated unit tests to work even if no CCD data is available

Version 2.0.1
- Fixed the generator for the symmetry operator table

Version 2.0.0

- Removed bzip2 support
- improved makefiles

- Now with full support for MS Windows

Version 1.1.0
- Changed from GNU configure to CMake.
- Loading compound information from CCD file

Version 1.0.1
- Changed the way resources are looked up, local dir first,
  then /var/cache and finally compiled in resources (with mrc).

Version 1.0.0
- First public release
