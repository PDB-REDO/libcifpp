Version 5.2.2
- Remove dependency on Eigen3 for users of libcifpp
- Fix typos in documentation

- small fixes for generating documentation
- correctly setting SONAME

Version 5.2.0
- With lots of documentation
- Refactored coloured text output

Version 5.0.8
- implemented find_first, find_min, find_max and count in category
- find1 now throws an exception if condition does not not exactly match one row
- Change in writing out PDB files, now looking up the original auth_seq_num
  via the pdbx_xxx_scheme categories based on the atom_site.auth_seq_num ->
  pdbx_xxx_scheme.pdb_seq_num relationship.
- fix memory leak in category

  was not found in the table.
- Improve code to locate resources, failing less.

Version 4.0.1
- Added a bunch of const methods to Datablock and Category.
- Changed PDB writing interface to accept Datablock instead of File.

Version 4.0.0
- getResidue in mmcif::Structure now requires both a
  sequence ID and an auth sequence ID. As a result the code was cleaned
  up considerably.

Version 3.0.5
- mmcif::Structure redesign. It is now a wrapper around a cif::Datablock.

Version 3.0.4
- Fix in mmCIF parser, now correctly handles the unquoted
  string ??

Version 3.0.3

- Fixed a problem introduced in refactoring mmcif::Atom
- Version string creation

Version 3.0.2
- refactored mmcif::Atom for performance reasons

Version 3.0.1
- Fixed processing of proline restraints file from CCP4, proline
  is a peptide, really.
- Added code to facilitate DSSP

Version 3.0.0

  then /var/cache and finally compiled in resources (with mrc).

Version 1.0.0
- First public release
