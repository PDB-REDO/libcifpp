# libcifpp

This library contains code to work with mmCIF and legacy PDB files.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found at https://www.hekkelman.com/libcifpp-doc/

## Synopsis

```c++
// A simple program counting residues with an OXT atom

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

#include <cif++.hpp>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if (argc != 2)
        exit(1);

    // Read file, can be PDB or mmCIF and can even be compressed with gzip.
    cif::file file = cif::pdb::read(argv[1]);

    if (file.empty())
    {
        std::cerr << "Empty file" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    // Take the first datablock in the file
    auto &db = file.front();

    // Use the atom_site category
    auto &atom_site = db["atom_site"];

    // Count the atoms with atom-id "OXT"
    auto n = atom_site.count(cif::key("label_atom_id") == "OXT");

    std::cout << "File contains " << atom_site.size() << " atoms of which "
              << n << (n == 1 ? " is" : " are") << " OXT" << std::endl
              << "residues with an OXT are:" << std::endl;

    // Loop over all atoms with atom-id "OXT" and print out some info.
    // That info is extracted using structured binding in C++
    for (const auto &[asym, comp, seqnr] :
            atom_site.find<std::string, std::string, int>(
                cif::key("label_atom_id") == "OXT",
                "label_asym_id", "label_comp_id", "label_seq_id"))
    {
        std::cout << asym << ' ' << comp << ' ' << seqnr << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Installation

You might be able to use libcifpp from a package manager used by your
OS distribution. But most likely this package will be out-of-date.
Therefore it is recommended to build *libcifpp* from code. It is not
hard to do.

### Requirements

The code for this library was written in C++17. You therefore need a
recent compiler to build it. For the development gcc 9.4 and clang 9.0
have been used as well as MSVC version 2019.

Other requirements are:

- [cmake](https://cmake.org) A build tool.
- [mrc](https://github.com/mhekkel/mrc), a resource compiler that
  allows including data files into the executable making them easier to
  install. Strictly speaking this is optional, but at the expense of
  functionality.
- [libeigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a
  library to do amongst others matrix calculations. This usually can be
  installed using your package manager, in Debian/Ubuntu it is called
  `libeigen3-dev`
- [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib), the development version of this
  library. On Debian/Ubuntu this is the package `zlib1g-dev`.
- [boost](https://www.boost.org).

The Boost libraries are only needed in case you want to build the test
code or if you are using GCC. That last condition is due to a long
standing bug in the implementation of std::regex. It simply crashes
on the regular expressions used in the mmcif_pdbx dictionary and so
we use the boost regex implementation instead.

### Building

Building the code is as simple as typing:

```console
 git clone https://github.com/PDB-REDO/libcifpp.git --recurse-submodules
 cd libcifpp
 cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 cmake --build build
 cmake --install build
```

This checks out the source code from github, creates a new directory
where cmake stores its files. Run a configure, build the code and then
it installs the library and auxiliary files.

Tests are created by default, and to test the code you can run:

```console
 cmake --build build
 ctest --test-dir build
```
